## Data Filling

### Approach to Data Augmentation

In order to enhance the completeness and accuracy of the dataset, a data filling approach was implemented to address null values in IMDB scores, TMDB scores, and TMDB popularity metrics. The process involved the following steps:

1. **Null Value Identification:** Initial identification of null values within the IMDB scores, TMDB scores, and TMDB popularity columns across the dataset.

2. **Data Gathering:** Extraction of information about actors and directors from the dataset. This enabled a holistic view of the contributions of these key stakeholders.

3. **Average Calculation:** Computation of the average scores for other works of the same actors and directors based on their historical performance. This step provided insights into their consistent contribution to content quality.

4. **Null Value Replacement:** Substitution of the null values in IMDB scores, TMDB scores, and TMDB popularity with the calculated averages. This approach ensured that missing data points were filled with values reflecting the artistic quality and popularity trend of the creators' previous works.

### Significance

By employing this data augmentation technique, the dataset's reliability and robustness were improved. The process allowed for a more comprehensive analysis by eliminating gaps in the metrics used for evaluation. The enhanced dataset further enriched the insights derived from the correlation between IMDB scores, TMDB popularity, and TMDB scores.
